# Assembly

This project is creating an assembly simulator in C++, starting with basic
[Y86](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/ch4-preview.pdf) commands.

## Requirements

Having gcc installed:
* Linux usually comes with this
* [Mac OS X](https://www.mkyong.com/mac/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-mac-os-x/)
* [Windows](http://preshing.com/20141108/how-to-install-the-latest-gcc-on-windows/)

I'll probably create a makefile for this, but for now, just manual compilation
